# Contact list component with Vue

A small Vue-application built using Vite. It gets random users from the [Random user generator](https://randomuser.me/) and adds them to a contact list.

## Getting started:

- Run the command `npm install`in your terminal
- To start the dev server use `npm run dev`
- To build the application use `npm run build`

## Further improvements:

- The contact list component could be more reusable and have different API:s and kinds of lists as input, but I couldn't quite figure out how to be less specific with the API:s object paths and so on.
- The contact list could be broken up into smaller components.
- The sorting functionality could probably be separated from the list component and more reusable as well.
- Not completely sure if the build of the app is working as it should, I can't preview it locally but I have not tried to publish it.
