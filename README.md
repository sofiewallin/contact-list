# Contact list component with Vue

A small Vue-application built using Vite. It gets random users from the [Random user generator](https://randomuser.me/) and adds them to a contact list.

## Getting started:

- Run the command `npm install`in your terminal
- To start the dev server use `npm run dev`
- To build the application use `npm run build`

## Further improvements:

- Images in the table are at this moment pretty set in how they are being displayed, perhaps they could be more configurable with input for style and size.
â€“ Perhaps it's possible to get even more control of the styling of each data-cell with input for line-breaks where you want them and even for bold and italic styles of specific text.
- Not completely sure if the build of the app is working as it should, I can't preview it locally but I have not tried to publish it.
